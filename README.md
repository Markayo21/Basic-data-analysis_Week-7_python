# Iris Analysis - Data Analysis and Visualization

## Description

This project focuses on analyzing the famous Iris dataset, which contains measurements of sepal and petal lengths and widths for different Iris species. The goal is to explore the data, clean it, perform basic statistical analysis, and visualize the results using Python libraries such as **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   




I chose a scatter plot because it helps to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables (sepal length and petal length).
The scatter plot shows that the Setosa species has shorter petal and sepal lengths compared to Versicolor and Virginica.
