# Iris Analysis - Data Analysis and Visualization

## Description

This project focuses on analyzing the famous Iris dataset, which contains measurements of sepal and petal lengths and widths for different Iris species. The goal is to explore the data, clean it, perform basic statistical analysis, and visualize the results using Python libraries such as **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**

I chose a scatter plot because it helps to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables (sepal length and petal length).

 ## Data Analysis
The dataset was cleaned, and missing values were handled. Basic statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation were computed for each numerical column. The data was then grouped by species, and the average sepal and petal measurements for each group were calculated.

## Key Findings:
Sepal length varies significantly between species, with Setosa having the smallest average and Virginica having the largest.

Petal width is a strong indicator of species, with Setosa having a distinctly smaller average petal width compared to the others.

Species correlation: Petal length and petal width are closely correlated for all species, while sepal dimensions vary more widely across species.

## Visualizations
The following visualizations were created:

Line Chart: Trends in petal length over time (if your dataset had a time component).

Bar Chart: Average petal length per species.

Histogram: Distribution of petal lengths across all samples.

Scatter Plot: Relationship between sepal length and petal length for each species.

These visualizations help uncover patterns and relationships within the Iris dataset, providing insight into how different species can be distinguished by their physical measurements.
